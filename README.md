 - User story: I can search for city
 - User story: I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
 - User story: I can see the date and location of the weather
 - User story: I can see according to image for each type of weather
 - User story: I can see the min and max degree each day
 - User story: I can see wind status and wind direction
 - User story: I can see humidity percentage
 - User story: I can see a visibility indicator
 - User story: I can see the air pressure number
 - User story(optional): I can request my current location weather
